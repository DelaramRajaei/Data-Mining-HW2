# Data-Mining-HW2
This project is based on creating a model with Keras and TenserFlow libraries to cluster the given dataset by their label. The evaluation of the model is checked by graphs and calculated accuracy. After creating an accurate model with an acceptable accuracy, the model used for a bigger dataset. 
Given tasks are:
-	Finding the best number of nodes in a layer
-	Finding the best number of hidden layers
-	Add the suitable activation function
-	Learn how to work with TenserFlow and Keras
-	Change the learning rate 
-	Add the suitable loss function
Tech stack: 
Programming language: Python
Libraries used in this project: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, TenserFlow, Keras
